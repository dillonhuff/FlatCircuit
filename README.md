# Circuit Specialization

This is an experimental RTL simulator that can perform runtime circuit
specialization to accelerate simulations of reconfigurable architectures.

# Dependencies

The simulator currently reads in coreir or its own simplified file format.
To read in verilog you will need to download the VerilogToCoreIR tool.
